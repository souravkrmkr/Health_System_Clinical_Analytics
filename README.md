## Exploratory Data Analysis on data of Diabetic/Non-Diabetic patients to understand the underlying pattern causing this chronic disease

### INTRODUCTION:

Diabetes, a chronic disease which can cause due to two conditions:
-  When the pancreas does not produce enough insulin - Type I
-  When the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces - Type II

Among the diabetes patients, almost 95% are of Type II and is largely the result of excess body weight and physical inactivity. However, the reason for Type I diabetes is still unknown.

#### Why is diabetes chronic and dangerous?

Well, it can cause serious health hazards such as blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke, lower limb amputation, nerve damage and are highly at risk of diseases like Covid-19.

As per WHO (World Health Organization) report,

-  The number of people with diabetes rose from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Prevalence has been rising more rapidly in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries
-  Between 2000 and 2019, there was a 3% increase in diabetes mortality rates by age
-  In 2019, diabetes and kidney disease due to diabetes caused an estimated 2 million deaths
-  In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years

Unlike Type I diabetes which is difficult to predict, Type II diabetes however, can be predicted and a timely treatment can reverse diabetes nowadays. There are few ways to identify early symptoms of diabetes such as inexpensive blood glucose measurement. Very simple steps such as maintaining healty body weight, staying physically active, eating a healthy diet, avoiding sugar and saturated fats, avoiding tobacco etc. can be effective in preventing or delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes.

With this analysis we shall try to draw conclusion on what are the major factors that can be used to diagnose Type II diabetes and what are the preventions that can be taken to stay away from this chronic disease.
